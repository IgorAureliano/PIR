    "Introduced by Chor, Goldreich e Kushilevitz [1,2] in 1995, Private Information Retrieval (PIR) is a cryptographic protocol used to access a specific message in a distributed database replicated in some servers without revealing any information about which message is being accessed to the servers. PIR has many interesting applications such as private research, access to medical documents, bank accounts, market statistics for business investment, video streaming services, among others.\n",
    "\n",
    "A PIR scheme must be able to access the information desired by the user in such a way that any server is unable to learn any information about what information is being accessed. Thus, a trivial solution to the problem could be the user download the entire database from a server. In this way, the user will have all the messages in the database, which guarantees access to the desired information while ensuring security, because the user shows interest in all the messages in the database, so the server remains unaware of which message is of interest. However, as modern databases have a high amount of information stored, this solution is considered computationally expensive and impractical. Therefore, the user wants to minimize the total communication cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "An interesting approach to this problem is that we can use Secret Sharing to create PIR schemes. The main idea is to use polynomials over finite fields, since polynomials provide a simple and efficient way of generating and combining secret data such as solving linear systems or taking a polynomial interpolation. In addition, finite fields will provide algebraic and statistical properties that make PIR schemes perfectly secure from the Information Theory perspective.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will present Private Information Retrieval using Secret Sharing schemes, motivating from the most straightforward scheme to the most elaborate schemes that are optimal for finite parameters. For all possible solutions to the problem, we will present a possible implementation of the algorithm and a demonstration of why the scheme has the properties of retrieving and securing the desired message."

    "In private information retrieval (PIR), a user wants private access a specific message $D_i \\in \\text{GF}(q)$ stored in entry $i \\in [M]$ of a distributed database $D \\in \\text{GF}^{M}(q)$ replicated in $N$ servers without revealing any information about which message is being accessed to any server. Note that all servers know what information is stored in the database, so our goal is to keep the value of the desired index $i$ secure. The most straightforward solution discussed in the introduction involves the user downloading the entire database. In this way, the user would be able to access the desired message $D_i$ while keeping the desired index $i$ secure, because the user declares interest in all entries at the same time, i.e. the servers cannot tell which index the user is interested in. However, since the modern databases have a high amount of information stored, this solution is considered computationally expensive and impractical. Then, the user has an interest in minimizing the computational costs of communication, i.e., Upload and Download.\n",

The reason for thinking of the database in this way instead of $D=[D_1,D_2,...,D_{sM} ]^t \\in \\text{GF}^{sM}(q)$ is that the server can reuse the queries $Q_j$ to retrieve all the symbols of the desired message $D_i \\in \\text{GF}^{s}(q)$.

The $(N,T+1)$-Threshold Secret Sharing scheme has an interesting property that even if $N-T-1$ shares are lost/erased, it will still be possible to recover the secret $S \\in \\text{GF}(q)$, because the scheme only needs $T+1$ linearly independent combinations to interpolate $f(x)$. In other words, the scheme is resilient against $N-T-1$ erasures. However, suppose we do not want to be resilient to erasures. In this case, we can modify the $(N,T+1)$-Threshold Secret Sharing scheme to share more secrets by increasing the degree of $f(x)$ and placing the secrets as coefficients. This will make us less resilient to erasures, but we will be able to share more secrets securely. This idea can be generalized to the following scheme: \n",

In Lift, we do the same process in a recursive way from $M=2$ to $M=3$, $M=3$ to $M=4$, up to an arbitrary $M$.

    "We presented a possible solution to the PIR problem with replicated databases using the Secret Sharing cryptographic algorithm, which uses polynomials over finite fields. We saw that when the database has arbitrarily large messages, the download rate dominates, which led us to focus on contructing PIR schemes that optimize the download rate. In addition, we saw that the direct application of Secret Sharing schemes does not achieve the highest known download rate for the problem, called Capacity, which motivated us to present Refine and Lift techniques to obtain optimal PIR schemes for finite parameters through the original formulation of the problem where there are no errors. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Refine and Lift techniques transform any Secret Sharing scheme into an optimal scheme for databases replicated on $N$ servers where $T$ collude. However, due to the errors and erasures that naturally occur in any database, there is a great deal of interest in PIR schemes that are resilient to errors and erasures. In this case, the Refine and Lift techniques can also be used to build PIR schemes where an MDS error-correcting code is used, typically a Reed-Solomon code. Therefore, if the reader is interested, we strongly recommend reading the references [11] and [12]."
